    <h1> My Favourite Hobby </h1>
    <h2> Drawing </h2>
      <h4 id="font"> My favourite hobby is drawing.I think drawing is the best hobby. You can create art anywhere as long as you have two things: pencils and paper. It's good to start at a young age because it gives you a chance to start using your brain and to be creative. Also, it is an opportunity to challenge thinking skills and develop learning skills.I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness. My most favourite time is when I come back from school because at that time I get free time to paint.I love to draw my mother and fatherâ€™s pictures on my notebook. They are my favourite drawings. I also love to paint fruits like mango, orange and banana. My mother motivates me to draw more and more. In my school also, everyone loves my drawings. Whenever there is a school competition, my teachers call me to participate. In my home, there is a small room made by my father. In that room, I have kept all the pictures which I have drawn. I have drawn mango, cow, apple, banana and many more.</h4>
